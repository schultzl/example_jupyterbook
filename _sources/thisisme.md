## About me

I'm Larissa. I was born and grew up in Brazil, then moved to Germany when I
was just 17y. I came all by myself without speaking the language. Still, I
had a goal: get my Bachelor's degree. What came on top of it developed 
from this very starting point.

... and truth be told, a lot developed from this. To name a couple of things, by now I finished a
PhD in physical oceanography (large data sets/field data) and I'm a self-taught 
programmer and cloud enthusiast. While I could tell you many stories about this path, 
I'll probably stick to how I moved from being a scientific researcher to a IT Consultant / Data 
Scientist / Logistics expert ({doc}`stepstotransition`). I'll also touch upon the why ({doc}`whytransition`) - but that's really not that relevant 
here. I'm a scientist at heart and I'm amazed by all that my former peers and friends accomplish. No
path seems perfect from my experience, you just have to find out what works best for you.

Because the only certainty in this world is change, I prefer not to set very
longterm goals. I set midterm goals and check-in with myself every now and then 
if they still reflect who I am and want to develop into. You might totally disagree
with this approach and that's alright. Just keep this in mind when you read the next pages, it might
help understanding where I'm coming from.
