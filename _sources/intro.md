# Dr. techies - General notes

<sub>or: where can you really work once you leave academia if you've learned at least one programming language?</sub>

First things first: a scientific career is something very respectable to me and, if I have any 
role models, these are most likely scientists. Still I, and certainly many of the readers, 
can empathize with all ups and downs scientists go through - as well as with the reasons why they 
might want to opt out.

In this document, I aim to present some of the knowledge and thoughts I've collected throughout
the years on the topic of transitioning from academia to the private sector as a techie. I've been asked 
many times which steps I followed and what I find most relevant... so now I decided to write 
it up in a concise way.

```{note}
I'm neither a coach, nor a career expert. This document is clearly not career advice.
You're encouraged to read this document for entertainment purposes, and take it
as food for thought. Still, it is your responsibility do your own research before 
you derive any conclusions. 
```

To be completely transparent, I'm also using the opportunity to showcase GitHub Actions and
[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), the latter being an open source tool
that allows the generation of books/documents using markdown files that may include code
cells, or even entire notebooks (`.ipynb`). This way I generate some content that could be interesting
to anyone out there - while demonstrating knowlegde of a technical tool (*wink*).
