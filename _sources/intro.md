# Dr. techies - General notes

<sub>or: where can you really work once you leave academia if you've learned at least one programming language?</sub>

First things first: a scientific career is something very respectable to me and, if I have any 
role models, these are most likely scientists. Still I, and certainly many of the readers, 
can empathize with all ups and downs scientists go through - as well as with the reasons why they 
might want to opt out.

In this document, I aim to present some of the knowledge and thoughts I've collected throughout
the years on the topic of transitioning from academia to the private sector as a techie. I've been asked 
many times which steps I followed and what I find most relevant... so now I decided to write 
it up in a concise way.

To be completely transparent, I'm also using the opportunity to showcase GitHub Actions and
[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), the latter being an open source tool
that allows the generation of books/documents using markdown files that may include code
cells, or even entire notebooks (`.ipynb`). This way I generate some content that could be interesting
to anyone out there - while demonstrating knowlegde of a technical tool (*wink*).
