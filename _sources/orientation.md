## Where can you go?

As one approaches the end of the PhD project, many questions beyond the project itself arise. One of these questions qill inevitably be related to one's next career steps, and whether to stay in or go out of academia.

Regardless of your motivation to work on your PhD project, once you've finished, you belong to the 2% of the population with this educational level ([Education at a Glance 2022, OECD](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/3197152b-en.pdf?expires=1674567874&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=C8C5D25C4A7D467238E0EE94A0E80C49)). However, I'd argue that not your technical skills, but your work ethic and endurance is likely the most valuable asset you have to offer. Just think about the many problems for which you worked out a solution, or the countless times at which you had to rethink an approach/experiment to adjust for unforeseen confounders. The PhD journey teaches us to navigate through uncertainty and thrive on competitive and collaborative environments. Further, our independent thinking and problem-solving skills are a great plus. Own this and your insecurity level will likely decline.

As someone who prefers to make informed and conscious decisions, I found it helpful to consider all possible development paths before picking one - even though I was already tending towards one direction. In the following paragraphs I summarize typical pathways in- and outside academia. Please keep in mind that my insights gravitate to natural sciences given my background and might not apply to other disciplines.

### Academic pathways

At least one postdoc contract usually follows after finishing the PhD in Germany, in which you usually deepen your skills in a given direction and broaden your mentoring and teaching skills. Following the first postdoc, three main paths into research can be identified, which precede a permanent professorship: 

1. Further postdoc projects
2. Junior professorship
3. Team leadership

Postdocs run on limitted terms and tipically involve stays abroad, which are thought to be beneficial to broaden one's networks and perspectives. According to the German national report of scientific offspring ([BUWiN 2021](https://www.buwin.de/)), a survey in 2016 revealed that postdocs pursue on average 6.3 (median is 5) temporary working contracts since their start in academia.

Professorships are most often achieved through habilitation, junior/temporary professorship or team lead positions (with or without tenure track). Permanent positions in academia are rare and around 77% of all scientific offspring in the age range 35y-44y work on temporary contracts ([BUWiN 2021](https://www.buwin.de/)).

While aspiring an academic career, it is decisive to maintain a solid network through e.g. international cooperations and to cultivate a specific research profile for which you're remembered. Mobility, project- and self-management skills, risk tolerance and mobility are likewise important.


### Non-academic pathways

When I decided to leave academia, I was slightly overwhelmed by all the possibilities, variety of tasks and companies for which one can work. Yet let's be clear about the notion of "permanent contracts" in industry: while in academia a permanent contract is virtually "set in stone", in industry it's not. Especially in times of crisis, contracts can be terminated. Back to the start of the paragraph: since there are many possibilities, chances are you'll quickly find another job in this case - especially due to your tech affinity.

In a general sense, there are at least three paths to follow, which is not to say that you can't change from one to the other:

1. Technical path (focus on technical knowledge)
2. Project path (focus on project management and cooperation with others)
3. Management path (focus in creating and implementing a vision, strategy)

Many companies offer opportunities in each of these paths, so it's up to you to review which sectors and companies align with your interests and aspirations. Another thing to be considered is whether you'd prefer to work for a 
- start-up (or found one yourself :) ), 
- think-thank, 
- non-academic public sector, 
- small-, medium- or large-sized company.

... the dynamics, stability and chances for development across these institutions can be surprisingly different, so be sure to at least know what you're getting yourself into.

As for the job profiles, here are some possibilities to get you started:
- [Fullstack/Backend/Frontend developer](https://www.simplilearn.com/full-stack-vs-front-end-vs-back-end-developers-article)
- [Data scientist/Data analyst](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-analytics-tutorial/data-analyst-vs-data-scientist)
- [Cloud solutions architect](https://cloudacademy.com/blog/what-exactly-is-a-cloud-architect-and-how-do-you-become-one/)
- [Operations](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-a-system-administrator-a-career-guide)
- ...

It's recommendable to compare your skills with those listed in the job requirements, which you can use to set up your strategy. Don't worry about not fulfilling 100% of the requirements: you can it a shot if you have a good argument about why you'd like to work on a certain position, and if your skills are partially matching and transferable to the required skills.
