    "Especially under time pressure, it can be very tempting to solve a problem by quickly writing code without much care for its structure and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-taught programmers (as many scientific researchers are) have the additional challenge that they might not have learned a language in a structured way, where one goes through every step and slowly absorbs the coding etiquette. \"Learning by doing\" is a great way to acquire new skills, but it is hardly linear. Thus, there is a chance that some clean code concepts got lost along the way. The good news is that it is always a good idea to catch up on gaps that will make your code more professional and stable. Additionally, your collaborators will thank you.\n",
