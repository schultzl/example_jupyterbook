## Bye academia! Wait... why?

There's a widespread idea that junior scientists leave academia out of desperation given that longterm, reasonably paid, positions are generally rare. I was talking the other day about this topic with a dear friend of mine that happens to have gotten one of those golden tickets into a permanent position. During the conversation, we agreed that the topic is complicated in a number of different ways, however he made an interesting observation: there is generally one major goal in science, that of becoming a professor in your field. This lack of nuance is problematic. Imagine if the main goal of just anyone working in a coporate environment would be to become the CEO of a given company? This would be destined to fail.

A career in academia is a rough and risky journey, and that alone could be an argument to leave. Full disclosure though, it is not why I left.

Also I was starting to have conversations about embarking on a tenure track, my very own golden ticket. I spent long days pondering whether this path would indeed be the right one for me. On the one hand, there's an unspoken rule in academia that there is one noble, worthwhile, career to aspire: academia. ;) Thoughts about leaving can make you feel like a money-hungry traitor, abandoning Einstein, Marie Curie and everyone who's keeping up with the struggle. On the other hand, I've always been more of a *generalist*, or perhaps a *T-shaped* personality... but definitely not a specialist (see [Professional profiles: I vs. T vs. ___ ](https://jonathanken.medium.com/generalist-or-specialist-why-not-t-shaped-1aab6b98352f)). Let's be real, to be successful and respected, academics are usually expected to specialize deeply and become the masters in one tiny topic, which makes me feel somewhat claustrophobic.

On top, the longer you stay in academia, the more skeptical companies get about (1) your motivation to switch from academia to industry; and (2) your potential performance as you likely have limitted business/practical experience (in their eyes).

In summary, it seemed to me that the private sector would grant myself more freedom towards my generalist tendencies and interdisciplinary curiosity: some time ago I coded for project on financial reporting, a year later for the preservation of historical monuments and after that for enhancing traceability supply chains¹. I decided to leave earlier than later as the academic path and struggle no longer aligned to my life choices, but my reasons don't have to resonate with you - just know you're not alone if they do.

¹ This is true story by the way, I actually did that.
