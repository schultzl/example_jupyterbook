## Set up a game plan
### Key steps that helped me through the transition

Many scientists with programming experience are self-taught. It could be that their interest in air and sea dynamics led to the need of learning matlab, python... or actually fortran to be able to run simulations and navigate high-performance computing. It could, however, also be that data processing of growing organisms and high-resolution pictures of plankton at sea needed an upgrade from excel tables and raw-eye interpretation, which therefore also led to computer algorithms and AI.

In my case, my interest in biology and physics brought me to my interest in programming - and until now I haven't looked back. Truth is, there are many ways one can get from science to coding. Yet there are some steps needed to master the transition between being a scientist to being a data scientist/software developer. While I don't have a cookbook recipe to do that, I found looking into the following topics helpful (no specific order):

- **Understand your skills** \
Take some time to reflect on your skills, including what you enjoy doing, what you're good at, what you would like to do/develop into... and which of these are relevant to the market. The professional world keeps evolving, so will your skills and profession. Further, it's helpful to actively manage your career path yourself, otherwise someone else will do it for you not necessarily with your interests in mind. As noted in session ({doc}`orientation`), there are many opportunities to take on if you have learned a programming language. If you can't decide at this point if you'd prefer to focus on front/backend software development, data science, etc., you could start as an IT consultant. (IT) Consultants usually work in several types of projects and therefore have the chance to scan for pros and cons of different roles.

Oh, and do not forget that soft skills are as relevant as your technical skills. Don't underestimate the power of emotional intelligence. 


- **Review your CV** \
Since academia and industry have broadly different foci, you'll most likely need to adjust the wording and highlights of your CV for the transition. For example, your research articles are not as relevant in industry as they are in science. In my experience, it helps to be as concise and to the point as possible in your industry-ready CV. I mostly aim to keep it just 1 page long with the most relevant information to the position and company I'm applying to. Inevitably, to reach this, I omit my publications from it. While it feels a bit disappointing at first (hello, dear ego), there might be a chance here and there to mention one thing or two about them during the interviews - but don't overdo it, otherwise the interviewers might assume you're attached to academia and don't really want a job in industry.


- **Review/learn some key concepts** \
One of the good things about being a self-taught programmer is that it probably required a fair amount of brain stretches and frustrations to understand core concepts. Since you're considering staying on a coding profession, I'm assuming you enjoyed the brain teasers and the good deal of dopamine released when you got something to work. Great! While preparing your transition, make sure you didn't completely overlook topics, such as:

     1. OOP ([object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming))
     2. git ([Version control systems](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/why-git#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20biggest%20advantages,every%20change%20to%20your%20codebase.))
     3. AWS, Azure, GCP ([cloud services](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitchannel/definition/cloud-service-provider-cloud-provider))
     4. SQL/NoSQL ([databases](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-databases-to-use-in-2021-d7e6a85402ba))



- **Mind the wording!** \
In my experience, in the academic world we know and use many of the concepts and tools needed in the private sector. The difference is, in the private sector, these same concepts and tools are packed in fancier terms marketed to sell better. As science become more and more focused on publishing papers and receiving funding from private companies (depending on the field of research), this gap seems to be consistently closing. Still, before you become disencouraged to apply for a position because it requires knowledge in Cloud Computing or some trendy Machine Learning method, think twice if you have really no knowledge of those or similar skills.


- **Network and observe the industry** \
It helps to set up an account in a business social media platform (e.g. Xing, LinkedIN) to get used to recurring topics, trending methods, emerging technologies. These platforms are also very useful to scan how people managed to navigate from one role to another, which skills they have acquired and also to get a notion of time frames. You'll probably also notice that are many possible ways to reach a certain position, and the best thing is: you need only one. It's also OK to politely approach someone with a path that raised your attention and inspired you. By the way, it's not only social media: networking events and professional fairs work similarly.


- **Beware of the pace of work** \
When I started my first corporate job as an IT consultant, I was given a topic about an emerging technology to research on. I was curious and eager to dive into the topic and collect useful information to share with my colleagues as soon as possible. The "as soon as possible" timeframe that I had in mind would be around two weeks from the assignement date, which, to my surprise at the time, clearly diverged from the two days my boss imagined when he then asked me to present results. Even though somewhat terrified about being asked to resent something I had just started learning about, I was also amused about the difference in expectations and quickly grasped one key point: whilst in science we usually get time to research a topic extensively, in industry, the idea is to quickly get a very rough notion of what a technology is, its pros/cons. There's considerably less time to do research, but also noone is expecting you to become a bullet-proof expert in two days.





*Note: since the market is in great need of professionals with programming experience, I still believe that you can get in this career path even if you haven't learned a programmming language yet. How to make this jump is a more extensive and challenging topic, but I'd encourage you to look more deeply into that if you believe you could be into coding.*
